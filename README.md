Welcome to my personal blog
chapter I
This chapter of my blog focuses on my life during the summer of 2023 and to me that time was a real growing up period in my life. I was privileged to have the resources to travel the world and to complete my driver's license. Also you can see some of the funny lyrics that I wrote about those sometimes crazy times. The first chapter can now be read as a pdf file down below.

Chapter II
This is the second chapter of my blog and focuses on my life in between the interrail trip and the military. During these times I focused on sports and work for the most part. In general it was a good time of my life but somewhat chaotic and difficult.

Chapter III
This is the chapter that covers my life during my military service and everything around it. I can't lie about it being easy because it was not. However I got experiences that really changed the way I see and do things and friends with whom I have shared all these experiences with and thus we bonded hopefully making us friends for a long time even after the military.

Chapter IV

10.9-23.9.2024
This week we had only one assignment left and that was to return our gear back to the warehouse. The long 9 month journey ends as my friend drives me to the Kouvola train station. During our weekend me and my friends went on a cruise for two days which was a lot of fun. I must say that leaving the army is a very liberating emotion but I will miss somethings there such as the comrodary and having something to do all the time without having to think about anything for myself. But now life goes on and I have a lot of work to do in the homefront such as cleaning my house and taking a shower because I genuinely smell awful. 

24-09-29.09.2024
To begin I am finally starting to feel like myself and feeling like I have energy and drive. My current plans are to have a vacation meaning I will spend alot of time in my home and go to the country. After I am done with that I will start my work and hobbies. I am still wondering do I want to start training seriously again or to invest time in the workplace. The weather is still nice here in the Finnish standards about +10 celsius and sunshine. I hope that Finland wouldn't have winters at all. Soon it will be many months of darkness and snow. 

30.09-06.10.2024

This week I went to the countryside to my family's cottage to relax and find clarity. And I did... I went hiking a lot and also rowing. And of course like every Finn I heated up the sauna every night. Somebody might find it surpising but I enjoy doing chores around the estate such as emptying the shit and piss from the outdoor toilet's. During the week and I came back and saw some of my friends who came over to my house. 
07.10-13.10

This week concludes my so called vacation after the army. It has been a very normal week just repeating my normal activities. It ends my vacation because next monday I will luckily start my work and make some money for a change. Now I just n
eed to put my alarm clock on and pack my work bag. It will be very interesting to see how does doing normal work feel after such a long time and how I will fair in the new environment. 

14.10-21.10

This week I had my first week at work where I was ordered to blow leafs of the grass so the machine could take them to the dumpster. I feel good about my work and like the fact that I get to be outside and do physical labour. I must admit though it has not been easy to wake up six o clock and go to other town to work but I believe I will get used to it once time passes. 

22.10-27.10

So this the season is slowly changing and the winter hasn't quite yet arrived but it's definetely getting darker by the day. The week was a very normal one but the highlights were during the weekend when I went to assist my uncles friend with a moving job. Also my friend had a weekend pass from the army and I spent the whole sunday with him and also caught up with my old friend from abroad. This week has been an emotional rollercoaster but I got through it as usual.

04.11.-10.11

This time I had a hell of a week after ending the leafblowing and now I am switching to construction business. I did nothing unsual exept for going to jujitsu practises in a long time. It really felt good since I have been missing them for a year. I also receivied a real salary first time in a year. So to summarise I have gotten on my feet after a tough year. I also wrote an essay which can be read down below.

11.11-17.11

So it has been a pretty boring week since I have not had any work do to the countries political and seasonal circumstances. But I am glad that I have gotten time to rest because march is a very dark season and many people suffer from seasonal depression.  Even though it sometimes is hard I need to keep myself active and take care of myself. And of course I have been sending applications to different places and hope to find work next week but until then just gotta hold on.

18-24.11

This week I had work because of the snowfalls. We had to work long hours during the night but we all survived the difficult task. I also did something fun other than just sleeping. I went out with my friend and played badminton and visited the Gothic art exposee with my mother. I had to take this week of from training because I am getting accustomed to the shift work.

25.11-01.12

This week was mostly uneventfull because of the lack of snow and thus work also. Although during the weekend I did a moving gig. I spent this week mostly on my lonesome but during the afternoons I had grappling practises which have started to go on quite well. I feel like my cardio is coming back and I am developing technically little by little. Next week should start raining snow alot and therefore I should have more than enough work.

02.12-08.12

Now once again it has been quite a quiet week although I have started to go to competition class in jujitsu. Also celebrated the Finnish independence day with my family and friends. Not much else to tell except for feeling slight amount of seasonal depression.

09-16.12

So this week I resigned from my old job due to a lack of work. In Finland it is currently very difficult to find steady employment even with a degree. However even without work I find different ways to pass the time such as sports and musical hobbies. It's almost christmas time and it's getting pretty cold whilst darker as well. During these times the importance of staying relaxed but active becomes heightened.

17-21.12

This week I just participated in two training sessions during which we covered topics such as Anaconda choke and darce. For those not familiar with grappling techniques can google them but essentially they are submission techniques used in jujitsu. At last my friends have gotten out from the army and it is very good to see how they have matured during this tough year from recruits to men who are prepared for exeptional times. During my weekend I have already started celebrating christmass and have visited my friends and family. We did not do anything that out of ordinary but ordered some pizza and spent some time together. Last but not least I have also reordered hbo max and am currently rewatching the Harry Potter movie series. The old ones are much better in my opinion.

22-29.12

This week I took a week of from training and instead have done other things such as reading books. I have been reading a book about the British SAS forces which have really made an impression on me upon the subject of what a one man can accomplish if he has the will. I also have bough some sports equipment such as a weighted vest and skiis. 

30-6.1.2025

So this week I have been to skiing and little by little I am learning the ropes. I have also been to some jujitsu open mats which have been very instructive because I have been able to spar with diverse groups of practitioners. I also returned books to the library about my heritage research. I have been doing some studies about my roots from Savo and more presicely Kerim√§ki. I am feeling good whilst I can't lie about the seasonal depression having some kind of an impact on me.

07-12

So this week has been ordinary but still containing lots of niceties. For example me and my friends have been planning our soon to be trip to Lapland with a car. Also I need to start soon making house applications to Joensuu and apply for some new jobs once spring begins. Of course I have been to skiing and I finally have mastered the basic techniques and decending hills without falling down constantly. My jujitsu practises are going well now I have been working on speed endurance and soon will start gearing up my unaerobic strenght.

13-19.1.2025

Well once again a new week has dawned upon us.  It was quite warm and springy in the south of Finland but the tides changed in the end bringing coldness in to the south as well. I have been up to my normal routines but I can't tell lies being unemployed and waiting for my studies to commence is getting quite irritating. I am gratefull still that I have my hobbies and social connections to keep me somewhat occupied. I am glad that my road trip with friends is close by and can go skiing in the north.


20-26

Unfortunately we need to postpone the road trip by atleast two weeks due to my friends personal matters. I have finally started making new job applications and I believe a good profession for a few months would be working maintaining church properties such as graveyards and alike. I have changed my training program to include more explosive exercises such as running and jumping uphill with the weighted vest and doing exersices such as the snatch and the clean and jerk. During the weekend my friends came over as usual and I visited my godmothers who made great cooking for me which was greatly appreciated during such tough times in the world. Lastly I want to explain why I have not been up to anything creative and intellectual. That is because I feel myself needing rest from such matters before commencing my studies after so many years of hard labour.

27.01-02.02

So this week I finally sat down in front my my computer and sent some housing applications to Joensuu. I am frankly very surprised of the quality and the pricing of houses in the Finnish countryside. It feels like unbelievably cheap compared to the Housing in the capital district. 

03-10

This week I must say has been quite uneventfull with the weeks highlight being baking pizza with my friends and my mother coming over to my house. Next week however we should be able to go to the road trip with my friends. 
My friend funky kong has made cool virtual arcade games, I recommend for people to check them out they are very good and entertaining my personal favourite being the fruit basket.

1. Unity Play | abyssal treasure hunt game
2. 
3. 2. Space shooter

   4. 3. Fruit basket

         11-17
         
Finally we managed to conduct somekind of a road trip. However we did not drive to the north but we went to a cottage and camped there for a few days. The roadtrip shall wait until it it allowed by the circumstances that be. The trip was very relaxing and refreshing and it feels very good to get out of town for a change. I repeat once again that the more I travel the more I aspire to do it.

Tiny sidenote I have completed a tiny essay concerning a dear philosopher of my liking.
Essay on Arthur schopenhauer

  18-24
  
  It seems like spring is coming slowly but surely. I must confess my longing for the touch of sunlight and the blue sky of summer. We did small celebration of my birthday and turning of 21. I have changed my training regimen to focus more on low intensity high volume training for the time being.
  
24-04.03

I was feeling very unmotivated in my life mainly because of me not having feelings of personal developement from my passions such as martial arts. However I have discovered a new passion for the sport of muyay thai more commonly known as Thai-boxing. I must also add that I have purchased a video game called minecraft and found myself addicted.

05-4. 

Last week was a real active one atleast in my standards. I helped out my family with various chores such as bicycle maintainance and remont of a bathroom. In Thaiboxing I learned new things such as how to stay in better balance and staying calm under pressure. This was my first time in a swimming hall in a long time and also during the same visit I saw an old aqquintance of mine. During the weekend I went to see my friend in my old neighborhood and my relative came to my house to see me.

17-23

This was a fun week during which I went to association meeting, bough boxing gear, visited a sick relative and many other things. I must tell that my energy levels are going up considerably as the spring advances. However I feel somewhat exhausted from the various projects I am doing such as trying to move this blog to a django platform. Meaning that coding is very difficult.

  24-30
  
  I would state that the highlight of this week was definetely when I went to our summer cabin for some spring cleaning. It was really nice to feel the sunshine on my skin after a long winter and now that I finally get to be at home to enjoy the season.


31-6.4

i'ts been a busy week going around town and training really hard. But even so I found time for refreshing activities. Me and my friends went ahead and played tennis. First we did not land any shots in the field but after 90 minutes of playing we started to hit the atleast sometimes.

7-11

Now I have taken a week of from training focused other things such as editing this blog. I have also applied for some housing in my new soon to be hometown and I must tell you that I am very exicted about this new phase. But before that I hope to be soon embarking on another mission now travelling the old country via buss for a time unknown to man. In Finland we are finally getting better weather and I hope the winter is behind us for now.

08-13.0

This was a normal week execpt for the easter holidays which I spent with my family and in my own solitude. I finally made it to the boxing class of an old acquintance who is a very competent coach. I have not slept that well because of many stress factors in my life, and my most central concern is making people understand how I sometimes strugle and being agreable enough so that I would respect their personality enough. Overall I am managing things well externally, and I suppose it is good to handle one thing at a time!

14-27

I have finally gotten motivation back to do creative works which I might be publishin here in the close future. I am doing well in life, I wish I had more friends with whom I could spend time with. I have had such people but I feel like in some relationships sometimes you just need to let go if the other person never grows up and does not support your journey. 

I have written another essay on the matter of entrepreneurship in Finland, just copy it and paste it to your search field!

27.04-02.05

This week for some reason I have not been able to sleep properly. My thoughts are focused on my moving in a couple of weeks. I have spent time with my relatives and been playing monthly games on playstation. I am now plating a funny game called robocop. Also been reading deadly Hallows when not being able to sleep.

06-12

Finally we are moving to summer season more or less. This week I just packed my stuff and have started to fix some broken things that I have procrastinated in fixing. 
Me and my friend went to the local park to train boxing and it made me feel very positive and in a good mood. In the weekend I visited my healthy relatives (some of them had a flu) and we celebrated mother's day together with some cake. Sunday evening I drunk a couple of beers with my neighbour and that was my week summarised.

13-18

It's been a wonderfull week. Me and some of my friends put together a proposition for the governement to reform a law called unemployment security. It has been sent to the justice ministry for inspection and if it passes it should be votable at Kansalaisaloite.fi somewhere around next week. Overall I am feeling fine but am anxiously awaiting to move in 12 days time.
